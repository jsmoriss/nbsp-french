Adds a non-breaking space between (nbsp) words and punctuation marks to avoid inappropriate line-breaks in French.

== Description ==

This plugin converts spaces to HTML non-breaking space entities (ie. `&nbsp;`) in the content, excerpt, comments, text widget, and WooCommerce short description as required by French language punctuation rules.

If the `<!--:fr-->` HTML  tag is found (used by some multilingual plugins), non-breaking spaces are added only between the `<!--:fr-->` and `<!--:-->` HTML tags.

There are no plugin settings - simply install and activate the plugin.
